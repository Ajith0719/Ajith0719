## ðŸ§  About Me

Hey! I'm Ajith â€” I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from Kent State University. My journey into data began with a simple curiosity: Why do people make the decisions they do? Over time, that curiosity turned into a passion for finding patterns in data and turning them into stories that help people see the bigger picture. I get a real kick out of taking messy, chaotic datasets and transforming them into clear insights that actually mean something.

For me, itâ€™s not just about numbers â€” itâ€™s about helping teams and businesses make smarter, faster decisions through data. Thatâ€™s what keeps me going.

Thanks for stopping by!
